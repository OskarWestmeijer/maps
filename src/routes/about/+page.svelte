    <p>
      My name is <a href="https://oskar-westmeijer.com" class="link"><strong>Oskar Westmeijer</strong></a>. All my life I have enjoyed
      reading maps. I own multiple atlases and have spent countless hours
      simply skimming through them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since Google Maps came around, I tend to spend more time there. I mark
      interesting places, jump in street view, or plan an upcoming trip. Often I
      am curious about topographic features and investigate mountain ranges and
      river flows.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maps pair very well with my other passion: History. Borders and cities
      have changed since the beginning of nations. Seas, rivers and mountains act
      as natural barriers and define borders.
    </p>

    <h3 class="divider divider-accent">Tools & sharing</h3>
    <p>
      I create my maps with <a href="https://qgis.org">QGIS</a>, an open source
      GIS tool, and I use data from the European
      <a href="https://www.copernicus.eu/en">Copernicus Programme</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone is welcome to use my maps for free — whether for study, research,
      or personal projects.
