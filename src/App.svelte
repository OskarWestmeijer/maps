      <p>
        Large parts of the Netherlands are below sea level. For centuries, the
        Dutch have been reclaiming land from the water. Areas reclaimed from the
        sea are called "polders". The technique to dry the land is relatively
        simple:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The area is cut off from the sea by building a dike around it.</li>
        <li>The water is then pumped out.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The island of Flevoland, created in the 1950s and 1960s, was reclaimed
        from a body of water known as the IJsselmeer. It is the largest
        artificial island in the world.

      <h3 class="divider divider-accent">Germany forest coverage</h3>
      <p>
        In 2020 Germany was covered by 29,8% with forest. However, forested
        areas in Germany have been shrinking, with a total decline of approximately
        6.6% between 2012 and 2022. Germany is home to several famous forests,
        each with its unique history and significance:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Th√ºringer Wald (Thuringian Forest)</h4>
          <p>
            This forest is near the town of Eisenach, where Martin Luther
            translated the New Testament into German during his stay at Wartburg
            Castle.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Teutoburger Wald (Teutoburg Forest)</h4>
          <p>
            The forest has historical significance as the site of the Battle of
            the Teutoburg Forest (9 CE), where Germanic tribes ambushed and
            decisively defeated three Roman legions, halting Rome's expansion
            into Germania.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Schwarzwald (Black Forest)</h4>
          <p>
            Famous for its Kuckucksuhren (cuckoo clocks), handcrafted wooden
            clocks. It is also the setting of the 1980s TV series "Die
            Schwarzwaldklinik" (The Black Forest Clinic).
