      <p>
        Large parts of the Netherlands are below sea level. For centuries, the
        Dutch have been reclaiming land from the water. Areas reclaimed from the
        sea are called "polders". The technique to dry the land is relatively
        simple:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The area is cut off from the sea by building a dike around it.</li>
        <li>The water is then pumped out.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The island of Flevoland, created in the 1950s and 1960s, was reclaimed
        from a body of water known as the IJsselmeer. It is the largest
        artificial island in the world.

        history and significance:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Th√ºringer Wald (Thuringian Forest)</h4>
          <p>
            This forest is near the town of Eisenach, where Martin Luther
            translated the New Testament into German during his stay at Wartburg
            Castle.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Teutoburger Wald (Teutoburg Forest)</h4>
          <p>
            The forest has historical significance as the site of the Battle of
            the Teutoburg Forest (9 CE), where Germanic tribes ambushed and
            decisively defeated three Roman legions, halting Rome's expansion
            into Germania.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Schwarzwald (Black Forest)</h4>
          <p>
            Famous for its Kuckucksuhren (cuckoo clocks), handcrafted wooden
            clocks. It is also the setting of the 1980s TV series "Die
            Schwarzwaldklinik" (The Black Forest Clinic).

      <h3 class="divider divider-accent">Netherlands forest coverage</h3>
      <p>
        In 2020, the Netherlands had a forest coverage of just 10%, making it
        the second least forested country in the European Union after Malta
        (1%). This figure is significantly below the <a
          href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/edn-20210321-1#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20EU%20had,1990%20(145%20million%20hectares).&text=In%20five%20EU%20Member%20States,%25)%20and%20Latvia%20(53%25)."
          >EU average of 39%.</a
        >
        The Netherlands is a densely populated country. Despite that, it is home
        to two notable forests:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hoge Veluwe National Park</li>
        <li>Utrechtse Heuvelrug National Park</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="divider divider-accent">West Friesland, Netherlands</h3>
      <p>
        The Frisian tribes historically occupied regions along the North Sea
        coast, stretching from Denmark through Germany to the northeastern and
        northwestern parts of the Netherlands. During the Dutch Golden Age in
        the 16th century, the towns of Hoorn and Enkhuizen flourished, becoming
        extremely wealthy through trade. West Friesland is a distinct cultural
        region within todays province of North Holland.
